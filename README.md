# Linear-Regression-Model
Machine learning algorithm created from scratch with 81.8% accuracy. Built in python.

Uses linear regression to create a best fit equation for training data, then creates graphs comparing the results

This code uses dynamic iterative refinement to adjust accuracy. For the included datasets, I found 800-1000 iterations were sufficient for determining the weights.
